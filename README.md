# web-platform-tests RFCs

Most changes in web-platform-tests can be made directly in pull requests
following the usual review process.

The RFC (request for comments) process is used to request wider review for
substantial changes, which might impact other stakeholders or users of
web-platform-tests.

## When to use the RFC process

A few examples where the process is
likely to be useful:

 - Changes in [resources/](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/resources)
   which would affect many test authors, such as extending testharness.js.
 - Changes in [tools/](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/tools)
   which would affect downstream users of web-platform-tests, such as changing
   the manifest format or wptserve behavior.
 - Adding a new third-party code or service dependency.
 - Changing review workflows or policies.

As a rule of thumb, please use the RFC process when it would be useful and err
on the side of skipping it if in doubt!
